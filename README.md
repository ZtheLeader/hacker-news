# HackerNews by [Muhammad Zain](https://sites.google.com/view/meetzain)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## PS
A little note to the reader/evaluators by Zain:

>Hi dear Sir/Mam. Hope you're having a great Day. I got a little late on the submission. Reason for that is when I received this activity in my email inbox, **I was already away for one week on a tour.  And when I returned, my mother fell ill**. Now that I've found the chance, I've worked and completed the activity within 12 hours straight. (Hope this doesn't affect my evaluation process as I've completed it way earlier than 3 days span)
>
> This was a really fun and challenging activity and I've tried my best to deliver quality code. I've added comments, JSDocs, and named methods, variables so that you may understand them easily. I also committed frequently and made sure that commit messages are self explanatory. Hope there is nothing that you find hard to understand.

Also
> In the Task detail we're asked to filter `New` and `Top` stories but in Mockup there are New and Past stories.
> According to the available API: https://github.com/HackerNews/API#new-top-and-best-stories,
> Only New, Top and Best stories are available to be fetched So I'm implemented **New/Top/Best** stories to resolve any confusion
 
 
## Project Information

### Setting up
 1. Extract the project from compressed file.
 2. `cd hacker-news`
 3. Run `yarn` or `npm install`
 4. `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Additionally, to create a build run, ``yarn build``

### Unit Tests
`src/specs/App.test.js` file contains all the unit tests of available components and pages. Every `describe(..` block represents a separate test suit and there are multiple tests in when suit which are represented by `test(..` block. Tests descriptions should help in understanding  what is actually happening in a test.

Unit tests can be run by using `yarn test` command.

### Version Control and Branches
I've used git as version control and I've made extensive commits with self explanatory messages so that my progress is highlighted through commits. I've also made a few branches

 1. **`master`** is the default branch which has all the commits of other branches `merge`d in it.
 2. **`hackerNews/design-ui`** as the name suggests, I designed all the static UI and wrote Sass in this branch.
 3. **`hackerNews/implement-basic-functionality`** has basic functional part in it. Here I split my static UI into reusable components, create API methods, Implement pagination etc.
 4. **`hackerNews/implement-extra-functionality`** Here I add extra functionality which is beyond the description of Task. Like, I add React-Timeago here, Show loaded/total stories count here, hide Load More button if no more posts are here, and Introduce `loading` state etc.
 5. **`hackerNews/test-specs`** Implements Unit tests of all the components. Tests can be found in `src/specs/App.test.js`
 6. **`hackerNews/update-readme.md`** Updates the [README.md](README.md) file.
